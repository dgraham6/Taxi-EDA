## Project Summary

This project takes a deep dive into taxi trip durations using a large dataset of over 2.4 million taxi rides in Washington, D.C., from 2024. It looks at the data to find patterns and builds models to predict trip times more accurately. By adding extra data like weather conditions and the fastest routes, the project shows how using outside factors can improve predictions.

The process includes cleaning the data, making visualizations, and creating new features to boost model performance. Starting with a simple linear regression model, the RMSLE score was 0.824. By adding features like location, time, and traffic patterns, the final model brought the score down to 0.657, showing significant improvement.
